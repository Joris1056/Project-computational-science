# Welcome to our project!
This GitHub reposetory contains simulations of Parkinson's Disease within the substantia nigra. This reposetory was developed for Project Computational Science. 

# Packages
First of all we have the package Pyics that we use. This was introduced to us in Introduction Computational Science. And we used this to create an interface to run Parkinsons disease in the substantia nigra.

# How to run our code
To run a non-intervention parkinsons disease simulation in the substantia nigra, you'll need to go the Main.py. Here you'll get a interface 

To run a intervention parkinsosn disease simulation in the substantia nigra, you'll need to go to intervention-main.py

Finally to run the effect of intervention on years between 70% to 30% neurons alive plot. We created the research_q file. 

# Random search for the parameters (not used)

We have tried to implement random search to validate our parameters but this didn't work out because of the probabilities (90% to 95% which is weird) that it gave.
You will be able to run it in the random_search file and see our results in the random_search_results.csv.
