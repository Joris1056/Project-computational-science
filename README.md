Welcome to our project!

Our code is divided in 

First of all we have the package Pyics that we use. This was introduced to us in Introduction Computational Science. And we used this to create an interface to run Parkinsons disease in the substantia nigra.

To run a non-intervention parkinsons disease simulation in the substantia nigra, you'll need to go the main.py. Here you'll get a interface 

To run a intervention parkinsosn disease simulation in the substantia nigra, you'll need to go to intervention-main.py

Finally to run the 70% to 30% difference
